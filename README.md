# DapperHelperDemo
This is an example series where I set up a DapperHelper class to generate parameterized SQL statements for INSERTs and UPDATEs. These statements can then be used by Dapper to execute database calls.

This project is used in the following blog post:

* [Creating a Dapper Helper C# Class to Generate Parameterized SQL](https://exceptionnotfound.net/creating-a-dapper-helper-csharp-class-to-generate-parameterized-sql-inserts-and-updates/)

The posts for this series were originally part of my paid newsletter [The Catch Block](https://exceptionnotfound.net/tag/thecatchblock/); you can sign up to get The Catch Block every Wednesday by [clicking here](https://exceptionnotfound.net/membership/) and choosing one of the paid options (yearly or monthly).

The issues that use this repository are:
